## Tutorial on Recurrent Neural Network Language Models
Start with this tutorial: http://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/char\_rnn\_classification\_tutorial.html. This shows you how to set up a character level recurrent neural network language model to classify surnames into where they are from.

Then move on to the next tutorial: http://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/char\_rnn\_generation\_tutorial.html. This is an extension of the first tutorial which allows you to generate names given a nationality.
